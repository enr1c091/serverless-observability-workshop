In this workshop we have:

- Defined operational and business metrics for our application using CloudWatch Metrics.
- Monitored our API availability using AWS CloudWatch Synthetic Canaries.
- Defined a logging pattern to produce logs properly across our application.
- Centralized and analyzed our logs in CloudWatch and Elasticsearch.
- Enabled active tracing on API Gateway and Lambda and instrumented subsegments in our code using AWS X-Ray.
- Implemented code and service-level circuit breaker strategies in our application.
- Troubleshooted failed DynamoDB service calls using AWS CloudWatch Contributor Insights.
- Learned that gaining observability in serverless applications is not impossible, we just have to tweak our mindsets a little.
